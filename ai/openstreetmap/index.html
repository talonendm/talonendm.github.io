      If the map tiles are not shown correctly on a Leaflet map, there are a few potential causes for this issue.

First, make sure that you have correctly included the leaflet.js library in your HTML page and that you are using the correct URL for the map tiles. The leaflet.js library must be included in your page before you create the map, and the URL for the map tiles should be in the format https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png, where {s} is the server name, {z} is the zoom level, {x} is the x-coordinate, and {y} is the y-coordinate.

If the map tiles are still not shown correctly, the issue may be due to a problem with the server or with the network connection. In this case, you can try using a different map tile server, such as https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.fr/osmfr/{z}/{x}/{y}.png, or you can try using a different network connection to see if that resolves the issue.

If the problem persists, it is possible that the map data itself is corrupted or that there is an error in your code. In this case, you can try using a different dataset for the map and checking your code for any syntax errors or other issues that may be causing the problem.

For more information on using Leaflet to display map tiles, you can refer to the official Leaflet documentation.
