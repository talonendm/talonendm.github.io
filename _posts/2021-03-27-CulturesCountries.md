## Culture

> Haiku 俳句 is a type of short form poetry originally from Japan. Traditional Japanese haiku consist of three phrases that contain a kireji, or "cutting word" in a 5, 7, 5 pattern, and a kigo, or seasonal reference. Similar poems that do not adhere to these rules are generally classified as senryū. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku)

## Travelling to Japan

Flight from Helsinki 13-14 hours. Remember to take comfortable shoes - and such that are easy to wear. In economy class not enough space to use laptop, but remember to take it to cabin, because batteries are prohibited in checked baggage. They must be carried with the passenger in carry-on baggage. 

Electricity: I have been using European (220V) equipments with North American (120V) adapter in Japan (100V). However, some equipment, especially equipment involving heating (e.g. hair dryers), may not work properly or even get damaged. Read more about adapters e.g. [here](https://en-us.wikiconnections.org/power-supplies/continents/asia/what-can-i-connect-to-a-japanese-power-supply).

Not so big deal - few beers and I got new important kitchen tool.
  - From the same store I also bought small [Tawashi](https://takadatawashi.com/#kitchen) brush.
- Lunch at 3rd floor restaurant area. Remember to have cash - in many places credit card is not accepted. See image (private [sp](https://www.sports-tracker.com/workout/haques/63490a87f40e357cef6a7f8f)). High quality fish.

## Travelling

Most of my travel diary notes / logbooks are complete mess and even rather "stupid" notes. How many drinks, the cost of dinner, taxi etc. i.e. data. Other type of notes are how to travel next time. Notes to simulate Black Jack cards and odd calculation having one deck - just for fun not for beating the bank. "Our personalities were long thought to be fixed by the time we reach our 30s, but the latest research suggests they change throughout our lives – and bring some surprising benefits."
