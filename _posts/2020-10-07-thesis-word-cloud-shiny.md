# Master's thesis - Fault Detection by Adaptive Process Modeling for Nuclear Power Plant (2007)

Master's thesis that explores fault detection in nuclear power plants (NPPs) using adaptive process modeling. The author, Jaakko Talonen, from Helsinki University of Technology, details a methodology involving data mining (DM), principal component analysis (PCA), and weighted recursive least squares (WRLS). The core of the work focuses on analyzing NPP process data to identify subtle, slowly developing anomalies, such as leakages, that traditional methods might miss. The thesis also describes the development of a Data Management Tool (DMT) to facilitate this analysis, illustrating its application with a simulated leakage scenario to demonstrate the effectiveness of a derived leakage index.

## Summary (Note)

This master's thesis, conducted by Jaakko Talonen in collaboration with Teollisuuden Voima Oy (TVO) as part of the NoTeS project, focuses on developing methods for detecting slow-developing abnormal events in Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs). The core approach involves adaptive process modeling using recorded process data from NPPs, specifically Olkiluoto reactors in Finland. The research emphasizes data mining techniques, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for variable selection and feature extraction, and Weighted Recursive Least Squares (WRLS) for adaptive modeling. A key outcome is the development of a leakage detection method based on model estimation error, implemented within a custom-built Data Management Tool (DMT) in Matlab. The work addresses the critical need for early detection of faults like leakages or fouling to prevent more severe incidents and enhance NPP safety.

# FAQ

## What is the primary problem addressed by the research?

The main problem addressed by this research is the detection of slow-developing abnormal events in nuclear power plants (NPPs), such as leakages, heat-exchanger fouling, or calibration errors in flow indicators. Detecting these issues early is crucial to prevent more severe consequences.

## What methodology is employed for fault detection in nuclear power plants?

The methodology for fault detection involves adaptive process modeling using recorded process data from nuclear power plants. Specifically, the Weighted Recursive Least Squares (WRLS) method is utilized for adaptive modeling. A leakage detection method is then based on the model estimation error, where a fault is declared if the residual error exceeds a certain threshold.

## What data mining techniques are crucial to this fault detection system?

Several data mining techniques are crucial to this system:

- Data understanding and preparation: This involves exploring data quality, reliability, filtering (e.g., Moving Average, Exponentially Weighted Moving Average, Median filtering), differencing to measure the rate of change, and normalization (zero mean, unit variance, or range scaling).
- Variable selection and feature extraction: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a key tool for dimensionality reduction and identifying significant variables. Hotelling's T² statistics help in selecting statistically significant variables, while cross-correlation functions are used to identify delays between process variables. Dynamically similar variables are also identified.
- Modeling: The Weighted Recursive Least Squares (WRLS) method is used for adaptive modeling of nonstationary processes, with a time-varying forgetting factor to adapt to system changes.

## What is the purpose of the Data Management Tool (DMT) developed in this research?

The Data Management Tool (DMT) is a software programmed in Matlab that facilitates all data mining tasks for the project. It is structured into three main phases: preprocessing, variable selection, and modeling. The DMT allows users to select data, preprocess it, select and extract features, perform WRLS modeling, visualize results, and even manipulate data to simulate faults like leakages for testing the detection method. It also helps manage and utilize a database of statistical properties from various data sets.

## How are "slow developing" faults, like leakages, identified?

Slow-developing faults, such as leakages, are identified by monitoring the model estimation error generated by the adaptive Weighted Recursive Least Squares (WRLS) model. When a fault occurs, the process variables' behavior changes, causing the WRLS model's estimate to drift, leading to an increasing estimation error. A "leakage index" is then created based on this cumulative estimation error, which rises if a real leakage situation is detected, indicating an abnormal system state.

## What is the significance of "adaptive modeling" and "time-varying forgetting factor" in this context?

Adaptive modeling, specifically using Weighted Recursive Least Squares (WRLS), is significant because it allows the model to continuously update its parameters based on new data, making it suitable for nonstationary processes like those in nuclear power plants. The "time-varying forgetting factor" (λ) further enhances this adaptivity. It determines how quickly older data points are "forgotten," allowing the model to respond more rapidly to abrupt or sudden changes in the system (e.g., a developing fault), as a larger error causes older data to be forgotten faster. This ensures the model remains robust and sensitive to deviations from normal operation.

## What types of data were used in the experiments and where did they originate?

The experiments primarily used high-frequency process data recorded from the Olkiluoto nuclear power plant, specifically from reactor 2. Data sets were delivered via compact discs and represented time series of numerous signals. A total of 37 data sets from both reactors were used to create a database of statistical properties for preprocessing, but simulator data was excluded from this database. The specific case analyzed in detail involved a pump stopping in the primary circulation system of Olkiluoto 2 reactor.

## What are some of the potential challenges and future developments discussed for this fault detection system?

Challenges include dealing with noise in raw data, the risk of losing relevant information with excessive smoothing, and ensuring that statistically significant variables truly relate to a fault. Problems in data mining and modeling also arise if preprocessing parameters are not optimal. Future developments include refining the leakage index for clearer user representation, improving data mining of all available data sets by storing more comprehensive information like delays between variables, and exploring other modeling techniques such as Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) or Kalman filters.

## Leakage Detection by Adaptive Process Modeling (2008)

This source describes a method for detecting steam line leakages in a boiling water reactor (BWR) nuclear power plant using adaptive process modeling. The authors propose an adaptive linear approach for time series modeling, employing the Weighted Recursive Least Squares (WRLS) method. To ensure a robust model, they utilize Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to select linearly correlated interpretive variables, examining eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The developed leakage detection index is based on the model estimation error, proving particularly effective for small pipe flows and offering an alternative to other sensors for early detection.

- further development and this article was based on Master's Thesis (2007)

### Why is adaptive modeling preferred over static models for industrial processes like nuclear power plants?

Industrial processes are inherently nonstationary, meaning their statistical properties and dependencies between variables can change over time due to various factors like different process states or external conditions (e.g., seasonal variations). Static models, while useful for training simulators or understanding plant dynamics, are not accurate enough for fault detection in such dynamic environments. Adaptive modeling, on the other hand, allows the model to continuously update its coefficients, enabling it to recognize abnormal events in these dynamic processes.

## Publication II: "Abnormal Process State Detection by Cluster Center Point Monitoring in BWR Nuclear Power Plant"

This paper introduces a novel approach for abnormal process state detection in nuclear power plants, specifically demonstrated using data from the Olkiluoto Boiling Water Reactor. The method focuses on monitoring the movement of cluster center points in real-time, classifying process signals into "slow" and "fast" categories using the K-means algorithm. By extracting statistical features like absolute difference and moving standard deviation, the system aims to provide early detection of potential faults, thereby enhancing plant safety and reducing operational costs. The proposed technique is presented as an improvement over traditional monitoring methods and even other multivariate statistical approaches like Hotelling's T^2 statistics, offering a simpler and more effective tool for operators to identify pre-stages of process anomalies.

### Core Problem & Motivation

- High Dimensionality and Manual Selection Burden: NPPs like Olkiluoto measure and monitor thousands of signals, making manual selection and monitoring "arduous" due to the "high dimensionality of the system."
- Alarm Overload: Control room operators at Olkiluoto are "overloaded with alarms and notification which make it difficult for the operator to make discerning decision." This necessitates "alarm sanitation."
- Need for Early Fault Detection: Existing monitoring systems often detect faults after they have developed, leading to potential significant impacts on large-scale systems. The goal is to detect "the pre-stages of a process fault" to enable proactive intervention.
- Limitations of Traditional Methods: Traditional methods like Shewhart charts and limit value checking struggle to find "correct target value and limit values for each signal" due to the variety of signal types in industrial processes.

### Proposed Method: Cluster Center Point Monitoring

- An "unsteadiness" index is introduced, focusing specifically on monitoring the "cluster center point coordinates of the slow signals."
- The rationale for focusing on "slow" signals is that "there are remarkably large changes in some measurements in their normal operating state" which can temporarily increase "the center point coordinates of fast signals" (e.g., control flow changes, watering).
- The "unsteadiness limit can be adjusted to produce an automatic alarm." This alarm is based on the moving average of the cluster center point of the fast signals, with the current alarm limit being its minimum value.

> Simplicity for Operators: The "unsteadiness" index simplifies monitoring; "a notification system using the unsteadiness index works without operator monitoring."
