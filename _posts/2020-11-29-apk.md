# apk
"Android Package (APK) is the package file format used by the Android operating system, 
and a number of other Android-based operating systems for distribution and installation of mobile apps, mobile games and middleware." [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_application_package).

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** Never download apk-files from untrusted pages!

So, if you know and trust me, go ahead. Files with .apk extension are mainly meant for myself. In year 2040 I still can easily install my own helicopter game to my laptop! 

### Why Android application are available only here
Some apps were available in Google Play. However, I haven't had time to update sdk's and other settings, e.g. [icons](https://developer.android.com/google-play/resources/icon-design-specifications ) in the developer console. In addition, processing doesn't anymore use Ant. 

> Gradle build system: The Android mode now uses Gradle as its build system, after ant was deprecated in the Android SDK. When running your sketches from Processing, besides seeing different messages in the console when building the code, you should not notice any difference. However, this has implications when exporting your project. Before, the export was an ant project you could import into Eclipse with the Android Development Tools (ADT) plugin. ADT is no longer supported by Google, with Android Studio being the default development environment for Android. The export project option in the PDE will now create a Gradle project that you can build directly from the command line using the included Gradle Wrapper, or import into Android Studio.

## Beer Space

Beer Space (BS) is an application designed for multi-dimensional exploration of beer profiles. This program empowers users to delve into expert knowledge, pairing suitable food options with specific types of beer. With BS users can seamlessly navigate a diverse range of beer data, enhancing their understanding of various brews and their characteristics.

In the context of beer analysis, the beers are visualized with respect to two selected principal component axes using PCA. Principal Component Analysis is a statistical technique that helps reveal the underlying patterns and variability within multidimensional data. In this case, the chosen components serve as axes, offering a condensed representation of the diverse characteristics of different beers. By mapping the beers onto these PCA axes, we gain valuable insights into the relationships and distinctions between them based on the selected features, contributing to a clearer understanding of the beer landscape.

#### Likes :+1:

> Simple, effective and fun. Love it.

> Quick Easy Stats Perfect
> Perfect App for Slot racing in 1 line. Good Functionality, low impact from outside. Be aware it is not working with all devices. Needs a aproximity sensor. For 2 line race maybe a Image processing Software tool is better. Bit These are more sensitiv for external influences like shadows o.e.

> Very good. Sometimes (very few) he fails to count the lap. It would also be nice to see the time of all the laps, not just the last ten. Otherwise perfect. It would also be better with a small menu to personalize it a bit. I recommend it.

> Funktioniert! Einfach so. Kein Kalibrieren, einrichten. Smartphone hinlegen, App starten, Start drücken, fertig, losrasen. Einziges auszusetzen: Da der Bildschirm ziemlich klein ist, sind die Ergebnisse sehr fitzelig, kaum zu lesen. Praktisch wäre eine alternative Darstellung nur von aktueller und schnellster Runde, möglichst bildschirmfüllend . Dann wären es 5 Sterne :-)

> yessss - very good , uses magnetic sensor, try best position top left right bottom, wirh car before

{: .box-note}
**Note Nov, 2014:** Thanks! The location of magnetometer varies from corner to corner, but free apps are available for measuring and monitoring the magnetic field. These apps help on locating the smartphone sensor.


> Easy to use and fun Works great with my Xoom tablet and my Aurora AFX cars. Clever use of the magnetometer!

**Note Mar, 2014:** Nice to hear and thanks for review!


> Wow - Awesome fun

#### And some less positive user feedback

> Unreliable

> Does not work.

> Non parte.
